# DPhil Chapter 5 Code

This repository contains R code used for simulations and analyses in Chapter 5 of my DPhil thesis. It includes functions for simulating system dynamics, graph generation, and data processing. 

## How to Use

- The code requires R and some additional packages like `dplyr`, `igraph`, and `JuliaCall`.
- Example scripts are available in the `examples/` folder to show how the functions work.
